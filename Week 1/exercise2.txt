Difference between a declaration and a definition
  A declaration is merely the announcement of the existence of a symbol, like a
  function, variable, etc, and the type thereof (e.g. int). A definition actually
  assigns meaning to those symbols, such as what the function does or which
  value the variable is assigned.

Header files
  Header files are used to import, as it were, often-used functions to be able
  to use them in one's own program(s). As such, it precludes having to write all
  this functionality ourselves, and standardises the usage of some functionality.

Header files and libraries
  Header files are inserted as if they were copy pasted from their source into
  the source code at the place of the include statement. As such, it is used at
  the moment of compilation. Libraries, however, are included at the linking
  phase, i.e. when the executable is generated.
